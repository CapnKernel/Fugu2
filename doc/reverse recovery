reverse recovery of sync fet's (buck LS) body diode can cause server EMI and power loss.

During reverse recovery the mosfet is like a capacitor. In a half-bridge, imagine the HS switch
being a resistor and the LS a capacitor that is inversingly charged. current will flow until this capacitor
is fully discharged (Vds=0) and then the body diode interrupts. this can cause significant loss, because of the voltage
drop at HS is equal to the input voltage.

The current peaks at I_RM, which can be quite high. It takes the low resistance path across both switches.
Parasitic inductances in this path will cause ringing of the switching node voltage.
