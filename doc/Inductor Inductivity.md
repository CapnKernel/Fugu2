# materials

- https://www.cwsbytemark.com/mfg/sendust.php

* much lower core loss iron powder
* very high saturation level
* a little more expensive

material selection is a trade-off between core loss and saturation.
care must be taken about temperature dependency of A_l and core saturation.
TODO Sendust inductivity coefficient

MPP: low core loss
high flux: slightly lower loss than sendust. applications with high DC-bias current. limited choices

# Off-the-shelf inductors

many off-the-shelf inductors have flat wire winding for decreased ESR. with optimal copper/air ratio manufactureres
can make coils with different inductance values but the ESR and package size.
despite the heavy price tag, it might be useful to take a look what coils are available on digikey.
this way you can learn about whats physically possible, the data-sheet contain useful information
and might even give a clue about expected core loss.
